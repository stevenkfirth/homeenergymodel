    Inverter efficiency reduction as a function of shaded proportion and type of inverter is based on data from
    'Partial Shade Evaluation of Distributed Power Electronics for Photovoltaic Systems', Chris Deline et al,
    figure 7, accessed at: https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy12osti/54039.pdf.    
    
    The equations given in figure 7 were used to calculate the normalised power output for a range of different
    levels of panel covering, from 0 to 100% for the two inverter types represented (string and micro [aka optimised]). 
    
    The measured 37% transmission rate of the covering material was applied to determine the reduction in incident
    radiation at each level of coverage:
        % reduction in radiation reaching panel = percent of panel covered * (1 - 0.37)
    (where 1 = all radiation blocked, 0 = no reduction)      
    
    The level of shading was converted to a shading factor of the form used in HEM 
    (where 1 = no shading, 0 = complete shading):
        f_sh_dir = (1 - % reduction in radiation reaching panel)
        
    It was assumed that efficiency reduction being calculated is only related to the shading of *direct* radiation
    (not diffuse) on the basis that the impact is caused by part of the panel being shaded, while the rest is not. 
    Diffuse shading would affect the whole panel approximately equally, so should not affect inverter efficiency 
    in the same way. (Note that the reduction in output associated with the overall level of radiation - including 
    direct and diffuse shading - is separately accounted for).
    
    To set a reference point, it was assumed that, in the absence of a reduction due inverter efficiency, output would 
    be proportional to the incident solar radiation and therefore that the normalised output would be equal to the 
    shading factor - e.g. if 75% of the radiation was transmitted we would get 75% of the power output.
    
    The difference between this reference output and the output predicted by the equations representing the actual data
    was assumed to be due to the efficiency reduction of the inverter induced by overshading. The ratio of the 'expected'
    output and the 'actual' output was calculated. This step disaggregates the reduction due to inverter efficiency from 
    the reduction simply due to lower incident radiation, to avoid this being double counted. This is tehrefore the 
    correction factor needed in HEM to take into consideration the reduced efficiency of inverters when PV panels are 
    partially overshaded. 
    
    2nd order polynomial curves were fitted through the resulting inverter efficiency factors (as a function of the direct
    factor f_sh_dir, resulting in the equations used below). A two stage polynomial is needed for each inverter type
    because of the step change in behaviour when the 'lower limit' referred to in the source is reached.
